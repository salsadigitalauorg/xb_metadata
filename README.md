This project is a **proof of concept** demonstrating the customization of Drupal's Experience Builder module and its xb_ai submodule for CivicTheme's design system metadata integration.

## Project Overview

This repository showcases how Experience Builder can be extended to integrate with CivicTheme's design system metadata, providing enhanced AI-powered page building capabilities. The project includes:

- Customized Experience Builder module integration
- xb_ai submodule enhancements for design system metadata
- CivicTheme design system integration
- Metadata-driven component suggestions and layouts

**Note:** This is a development proof of concept built on Experience Builder, which is [currently under heavy development on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder). Experience Builder is not yet stable and could change at any time without warning.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This project requires cloning since it includes customized Experience Builder modules in `web/modules/custom/`. We use [DDEV](https://ddev.com/get-started/) (version 1.24.0 or later) as the default development tool for easy setup.

Clone this repository and run the following commands to get started:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:salsadigitalauorg/xb_metadata.git
cd xb_metadata
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev drush si -y

# Install the aggregated recipe (includes xb_demo, xb_page, civictheme_xb_demo, xb_media_search and AI config)
ddev drush recipe /var/www/html/recipes/civictheme_canvas_demo
ddev drush cr

# For Media Agent
Media Search is included via the aggregated recipe. Ensure the OpenAI provider is configured (see below), then clear caches:
ddev drush cr

# Now log in
ddev drush user:login xb/xb_page/2/editor
```
Now open the link Drush generated at the end to go right into Experience Builder.

## AI Provider Setup ðŸ¤–

This project ships with the OpenAI provider preconfigured via the `civictheme_canvas_demo` recipe. It uses the Drupal Key module to read the API key from a DDEV environment variable.

Whatâ€™s included:
- A Key entity with ID `openai` that uses the Key moduleâ€™s Environment provider to read `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `ai_provider_openai.settings` points `api_key` to that Key (`openai`).
- DDEV is configured to expose `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the web container.

Setup instructions:
1) Copy the example env file and set your key
```bash
cp .ddev/.env.example .ddev/.env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key" >> .ddev/.env
```

2) Restart DDEV to load the variable
```bash
ddev restart
```

3) Import recipe config (if not already applied) and clear caches
```bash
ddev drush recipe /var/www/html/recipes/civictheme_canvas_demo
ddev drush cr
```

Thatâ€™s it â€” Canvas media search and other AI features will use your OpenAI key securely via the Key module.
