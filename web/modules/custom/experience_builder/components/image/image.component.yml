  properties:
    # ⚠️ This looks very similar to `json-schema-definitions://experience_builder.module/image`, but with 2 additional object properties. That's because this SDC is meant to be used by other SDCs, so putting everything under a single top-level SDC prop would yield a poor Developer Experience. Hence this intentionally does NOT use `json-schema-definitions://experience_builder.module/image`.

      title: Image URL
      type: string
      # ⚠️ Note this does NOT specify `$ref: json-schema-definitions://experience_builder.module/image-uri`, see comment above.
