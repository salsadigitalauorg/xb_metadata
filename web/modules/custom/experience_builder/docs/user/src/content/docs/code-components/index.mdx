title: Code components
---

Code components contain your own JavaScript and CSS. They can be reused and
incorporate dynamic elements such as page data, custom input data, and 3rd party
API responses.

Components are rendered using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) with the
[React compatibility layer](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact/])
enabled.

## Adding a new component

New code components can be added from the Library panel. Click the `+` icon at
the top left of the screen and then `+ Add new`. Once the component has been
given a name, the code editor will appear.

The code editor will contain a simple starter component as an example.

```jsx
const Component = ({ text = 'Component' }) => {
  return <div className="text-3xl">{text}</div>;
};

export default Component;
```

The name of the component can be anything, but the code must provide a default
export.

Once the component has been edited, it can be saved and added to the library by
clicking the `Add to components` button.

## Importing other code components

You can import other components you have created in your code by prefixing them
with `@/components`.

```js
import Heading from '@/components/my_heading';
```

You can also do this through the UI by clicking the "Import components" button
in the top right of the editor.
