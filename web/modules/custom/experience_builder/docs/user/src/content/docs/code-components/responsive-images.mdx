A [standalone version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-image-standalone) of
[next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image)
is available to output responsive images.

```jsx
import Image from 'next-image-standalone';

const Cover = ({ photo }) => {
  // Add `photo` as an Image prop to have an object which contains the following properties:
  // src, alt, width, height
  return <Image {...photo} />;
};
```
