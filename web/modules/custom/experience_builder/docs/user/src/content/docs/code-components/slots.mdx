title: Code components - Slots
---

Slots allow you to place other code components, or any other Experience Builder
provided component, inside your component.

Builder. The form has an example showing slots named "Header" and "Button
Footer" with Example HTML/JSX values of a simple div element containing text](../../../assets/images/slots-1.webp)

```jsx
const Jumbotron = ({ header, buttonFooter }) => {
  return (
    <section>
      <div>{header}</div>
      <div>
        <button>
          <a href="#">CTA Button</a>
        </button>
        {buttonFooter}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Jumbotron;
```

Like props, the slot names are camelCased when passed as a parameter to the
component code.

Once a slot has been added to a component, saved, and then added to a page; a
slot will become visible in which other components can now be added.

panel, with 2 slots visible named "Header" and "Button Footer". Both slots are
also visible as an outline in the central page preview](../../../assets/images/slots-2.webp)

Components can now be added to the slot by dragging them in from the Library.
When a component is added to the slot, you will be able to configure its props
in the Settings panel which will appear on the right hand side.

rendering of both components, and the Settings section shows a form where a name
can be entered for the Hello component.](../../../assets/images/slots-3.webp)
