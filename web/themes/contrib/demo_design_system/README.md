# Starshot Demo Design System

For the [Starshot Demo Design System (SDDS)](https://www.drupal.org/project/demo_design_system)
project, we are building a demo design system and Drupal 10 theme based on
[CivicTheme](https://www.civictheme.io/).

This will be used by the [Starshot Experience Builder (XB)](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot/initiatives/experience-builder)
team at [DrupalCon Barcelona](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2024/session/experience-builder-initiative)
to show off its progress.

Check out the [official SDDS documentation](https://www.drupal.org/community-initiatives/starshot-demo-design-system).

## CivicTheme (for Starshot) theme

The base theme is a copy of CivicTheme in case we need to make any tweaks here
to support Stashot.

## Starshot Demo theme

The customizations for the Starshot demo are added to the subtheme.
